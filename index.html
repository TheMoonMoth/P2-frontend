          <h2>Why AbSense?</h2>
          <p>AbSense was made to simplify the absence reporting process.
          Rather than having parents call your school and hoping that the voice message
          makes it's way to the right paper copy file, AbSense digitally archives all submitted reports and make them
          easily accesable to administrators and families.</p>
          <h2>How to use AbSense</h2>
          <p>As a parent: Navigate through the "Parent Portal" and simply fill out the form
          specifying your students information. In the future, users will be able to create
          an account to store such information and making the reporting process even easier.
          <br>
          As an administrator: Navigate into the "Teacher Portal" to view all absentee reports. This feature
          is currently under development and you can expect a more robust archiving system as well as search and filter options.
